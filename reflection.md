What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
Set your priorities straight, learn how to use p5,play properly, spend less time creating sprites.

Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

I completed everything in my needs to have list except for sound, passive buff items, and the amount of enemy types. If I had another couple days or a week, I believe I could've implemented these fairly easily, but I needed to complete the base game first and make it playable. I completed a decent amount of the nice to haves list so it may have been a matter of my priorities not being set straight, whether they weren't set straight at the beginning or later during the project.

What was the hardest part of the project?

Working with the p5.play colliders was by far the most time consuming part of my project, with the enemy movement/spawning coming in a close second. I didn't figure out how to make them do what I wanted them to until looking at Saabir's code a few days before (thank you Saabir) and finding out you could make sprite overlap each other without them colliding no matter what their collider was. This made it so I could make certain things "bump" into each other without them bumping into everything.

Were there any problems you could not solve?

There are a few bugs that seemingly happen at random
- if you enter a room from above, theres a small chance the game crashes 
- In some runs, the shop doesn't work
- Sometimes dodge rolling stops midair
- Enemies can spawn with walls inside of them (i'm aware why this happens I just didn't bother fixing it)
